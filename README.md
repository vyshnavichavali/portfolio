Personal Portfolio - Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Project 1
This project is a web portfolio that was built for the Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. The goal was to create a responsive web page describing some design work I have done in the past.

My main focus for this project
This project contains no personal javascript code, intentionally. My focus has been directed toward writing readable HTML5 and CSS that would use proper elements, classes and ids, as well as just-enough styling rules that would complement bootstrap and other technologies utilized. This project should be rendered quite similarly in all modern browsers including IE, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Edge.

Technologies utilized
Bootstrap - for grid-based and responsive design, and image responsiveness
Polymer - for material design, paper-card style elements
Remodal - for integrating nicely designed modal for each project description
Freepik icons - for nicely designed social icons
What I learned from this project
Creating a sidebar
Creating a sticky footer
Playing with media queries for different rendering depending on which device is used and device orientation (portait vs. landscape)
Ajusting the design for cross-browser compatibility
Using new HTML5 tags such as header, aside, main, section, article, and footer
Targeting class and ids with regex in CSS
Deepening my comprehension on how to use the Chrome Developer Tool
Creating hover transitions with CSS
Writing markdown documents
Properly organizing CSS files (in a logical way)
Manipulating files with Gulp
